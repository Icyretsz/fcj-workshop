Throughout my internship at **Amazon Web Services / AWS FCJ Workforce** spanning **September 2025 to December 2025**, I gained valuable experience applying academic knowledge to practical workplace scenarios.  

My primary contribution involved **building TypeRush, a real-time multiplayer typing game platform leveraging AWS serverless technologies**. This project enabled me to strengthen my capabilities in **software development (JavaScript/Node.js, Python, React), cloud infrastructure (AWS Lambda, API Gateway, S3, CloudFront, WAF, RDS, DynamoDB, Cognito, Bedrock), operational practices (CI/CD pipelines, Docker containerization, system monitoring, security implementation, process automation), data engineering (Glue, Athena, QuickSight, SageMaker), interpersonal skills, collaborative work, analytical thinking, and workplace professionalism**.  

Regarding my work approach, I consistently maintained high standards for deliverables, adhered to organizational policies, and fostered positive relationships with team members to enhance collective productivity.

For an honest reflection of my internship experience, I have evaluated myself across the following dimensions:
