### Week 1 Achievements:
* Made new friends

* Learned about AWS services and explored different service categories.

* Gained knowledge of cost management on AWS using **AWS Budgets**.
    * Created cost budgets
    * Created usage budgets
    * Created reservation budgets
    * Created savings plans budgets
    * Become more conscious about costs and budgets. Make habit of checking the docs for cost policies before using any of AWS services

* Learned and practiced **AWS IAM**:
    * Created IAM users
    * Created and attached policies
    * Created roles
    * Made an IAM user assume a role
    * Logged in and tested authorization with assumed roles

* Learned and practiced **AWS Identity Center**:
    * Created user groups
    * Assigned users to groups
    * Created and attached permission sets to groups and accounts
    * Logged in and tested authorization with assigned permissions

* Studied the differences between **AWS IAM** and **AWS IAM Identity Center**:
    * AWS IAM and AWS IAM Identity Center are two separate services for access management.
    * AWS IAM focuses on managing individual users with their own set of credentials and permissions.
    * AWS IAM Identity Center (formerly AWS SSO) provides centralized sign-in, allowing users to access multiple AWS accounts and roles with a single login.
    * IAM Identity Center is generally preferred in organizational environments for easier user and access management.

* Strengthened understanding of access management and security in AWS through hands-on practice.
