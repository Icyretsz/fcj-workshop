### Week 8 Achievements:

**Focused AWS Solutions Architect Exam Preparation**
- Dedicated the entire week (20/10/2025–24/10/2025) to studying AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate (SAA-C03) exam questions using ExamTopics resources.
- Completed daily practice question sets to build familiarity with real exam patterns and scenario-based questions.
- Reviewed explanations for both correct and incorrect answers to deepen conceptual understanding and eliminate misconceptions.
- Strengthened time-management strategies by simulating exam-style timed sessions.

**Enhanced Understanding of Core AWS Architecture Principles**
- Reinforced AWS Well-Architected Framework pillars: Operational Excellence, Security, Reliability, Performance Efficiency, and Cost Optimization.
- Studied best practices for designing scalable, resilient, and fault-tolerant systems.
- Understood principles of decoupling, stateless architecture, distributed design, and elasticity.

**Improved Knowledge Across Key AWS Compute Services**
- Deepened understanding of EC2 instance families, use cases, and pricing models (On-Demand, Reserved, Spot, Savings Plans).
- Studied serverless compute patterns involving AWS Lambda, event sources, and execution environment behaviors.
- Reviewed ECS, EKS, and Fargate container orchestration models and their architectural trade-offs.
- Explored Auto Scaling strategies, health checks, scaling policies, and load balancing (ALB, NLB, CLB).

**Strengthened Expertise in AWS Storage & Database Services**
- Mastered S3 features: storage classes, lifecycle policies, versioning, replication, encryption, and performance optimization.
- Reviewed EBS volume types, throughput vs IOPS considerations, and snapshot lifecycle.
- Studied relational and non-relational database options including RDS, Aurora, DynamoDB, and ElastiCache.
- Understood backup, multi-AZ failover, read replicas, and high-availability configurations.

**Advanced VPC, Networking, and Security Knowledge**
- Analyzed VPC design components: subnets, route tables, NAT gateways, IGWs, VPC peering, and Transit Gateway.
- Clarified differences between Security Groups vs NACLs, public vs private subnets, and common network patterns.
- Studied Route 53 routing policies, DNS failover strategies, and global routing behaviors.
- Strengthened understanding of AWS KMS, encryption standards, IAM best practices, and cross-account access design.

**Expanded Knowledge of AWS Distributed Systems, HA & DR Strategies**
- Reviewed multi-AZ and multi-Region architectures for high availability.
- Studied disaster recovery strategies: backup-and-restore, pilot light, warm standby, and multi-site active-active.
- Learned techniques for building loosely coupled systems using SQS, SNS, EventBridge, and decoupled microservices.

**Deepened Understanding of Monitoring, Management & Automation**
- Studied CloudWatch metrics, logs, custom dashboards, and alarms.
- Reviewed CloudTrail audit logging and integration with security services.
- Explored CloudFormation IaC fundamentals, stack lifecycle, drift detection, and modularization.
- Understood Systems Manager capabilities for patching, inventory, and resource automation.

**Improved Cost Optimization & Billing Awareness**
- Reviewed architectural decisions that reduce cost while maintaining performance.
- Understood S3 Intelligent-Tiering, EC2 right-sizing, RI vs Savings Plans, and Spot instance strategies.
- Analyzed AWS cost visibility tools such as Cost Explorer, Budgets, and CUR.

**Practiced Exam-Focused Strategies**
- Identified common scenario patterns in SAA-C03 questions (migration, high availability, performance bottlenecks, security hardening).
- Applied elimination techniques for multi-answer questions and scenario interpretation.
- Learned to map AWS services to architectural use cases quickly and confidently.
- Improved ability to evaluate trade-offs between cost, performance, and reliability.
