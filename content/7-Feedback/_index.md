### Overall Evaluation

**1. Working Environment**  
The most satisfying aspect of my internship was working and learning together with my team. The collaborative environment made it enjoyable to tackle challenges and grow alongside others. However, I feel that the atmosphere could be more open and supportive, as sometimes it felt a bit oppressive, making students hesitant to ask for help.

**2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin**  
While the mentor and admin team provided support, I believe there is room to create a better mentor-student relationship. Encouraging more approachable and interactive guidance would help students feel more comfortable seeking assistance.

**3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major**  
The internship was not directly related to my major, but the knowledge and experience I gained may be useful for my future personal projects. I appreciated the opportunity to explore new areas, even if they were outside my main field of study.

**4. Learning & Skill Development Opportunities**  
The program relied heavily on self-taught learning. While this encouraged independence, I think clearer guidelines or orientation at the beginning would have helped, as I was unsure about my purpose and direction in the first few weeks.

**5. Company Culture & Team Spirit**  
The team was collaborative and supportive, but I would not strongly recommend this internship to friends unless they are comfortable with a self-directed approach. For those who prefer more structured guidance, independent study might be more beneficial before joining.

**6. Internship Policies / Benefits**  
Although I do not plan to continue with the program since it is not my major, I am grateful for the experience and the lessons learned. The knowledge gained could be valuable for future personal projects.
